description: What are we even doing here?

Hi!  My name is John de St. Germain.  I am from Louisiana, am currently 30, and have a beautiful wife and 3 kids. 

I am about 8 or 9 years into my career as being a mecahnical engineer and still loving it, but I also am a product owner for a fantastic piece of software at the company I work for and tech has always interested me.

I also pay for this domain, johndestgermain.com, and I have never really used it for anything helpful.  I decided why not learn a little bit more about some of the cool new tech out there and broaden my skills a little maybe by deploying this blog.

To start, it will just be using everything basic.  Maybe over time I will learn a thing or two and update it--who knows.  For now, just going to play around with updating things.

Current interests:  Rocket League, CharaChorder, and MonkeyType.com
